Hello.. So my program isn't entirely complete. It was harder than I anticipated and I wish we 
could've had more time because it about to be fun. Here is what I wasn't able to fully accomplish:

-- when you put the tiles on the scrabble board it doesn't generatre new tiles that replace the ones 
    we just used. Instead it replaces the entire racks tiles. Granted it still maintains the right amount of 
    tiles remaining and such but it doesnt replace the just the ones lost and so that requirement doesnt work 
    entirely right

-- the board doesn't clear after each round has been played

-- At the moment should you drag the tile to anywhere besides the rack, the board or the sides (left and right)
    of the rack, the tile is "trashed" and is replaced with a new one. I couldn't figure out how to simply append 
    the tile back onto the rack and so I wanted to try another route and all I could do was randomize so that atleast 
    the tile was dropped and not left there but it doesn't carry out the right function after being  dropped
    randomly

-- I couldn't finish working on not being able to move the tile once it has been placed on the board


Besides these I believe I accomplished all the other required details for this assignment. 

I worked with jason lazera through most of this project and so if you see similar functions it is because 
when we came across a problem we went back and forth with ideas to try and solve them. Besides that I believe I 
have included the link that I used to try and solve/learn throughout this assignment.
